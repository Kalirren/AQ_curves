# AQ_curves
Fitting multiple photosynthetic light response curves in R

In this repo you will find:
1) an R script (file="Fitting_AQ_curves.R") walking through the fitting of multiple A-Q curves. 
2) and two data files to test it out, one with simulated data (file="simulated_LRCs.RDS") and one with real world curves (file="athal_LRCs.RDS").
